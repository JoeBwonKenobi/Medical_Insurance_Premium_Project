# **Medical_Insurance_Premium_Project**
 Building a model to predict the yearly medical premiums

# **Overview:**

Health and medical insurance provide financial assistance to policyholders in case of medical emergencies by covering their expenses. An accurate determination of the insurance premium, based on factors such as age, health history, and profession, is crucial for building strong customer relationships, customizing health insurance plans, reducing risks, and making better decisions in risk management. This project uses data from an insurance company and creates a model to predict the premiums to help make an informed descision.

- The thing we want to firure out is called "PremiumPrice", and it  doesn't look like a bell curve when we plot it out. 
- This means we might need to use some special methods when we try to create models that explain PremiumPrice.
